Sorting algorithms are used to arrange a given sequence of elements in a particular order.Some of the basic sorting algorithms are:
(i) Bubble sort.
(ii) Insertion sort.
(iii) Selection sort.
(iv) Quick sort.
(i) Merge sort.

(i)Bubble sort:
Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that keeps on repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are not in correct order.This algo is suitable for small data sets.
Time Complexity:
(a)Best case - O(n)
(a)Best case - O(n²)
(a)Best case - O(n²)
Space Complexity-O(1)

(ii)Insertion sort:
Insertion sort is also a simple sorting algorithms in which the array is splitted into two parts, a sorted and an unsorted one.The elements from the unsorted array are picked and placed into sorted one in the correct order.
Time Complexity:
(a)Best case - O(n)
(a)Best case - O(n²)
(a)Best case - O(n²)
Space Complexity-O(1)

(iii)Selection sort:
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 
Time Complexity:
(a)Best case - O(n²)
(a)Best case - O(n²)
(a)Best case - O(n²)
Space Complexity-O(1)
