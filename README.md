Sorting algorithms are used to arrange a given sequence of elements in a particular order.Some of the basic sorting algorithms are:
(i) Bubble sort.
(ii) Insertion sort.
(iii) Selection sort.
(iv) Quick sort.
(i) Merge sort.

(i)Bubble sort:
Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that keeps on repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are not in correct order.This algo is suitable for small data sets.
Time Complexity:
(a)Best case - O(n)
(a)Average case - O(n²)
(a)Worst case - O(n²)
Space Complexity-O(1)

(ii)Insertion sort:
Insertion sort is also a simple sorting algorithms in which the array is splitted into two parts, a sorted and an unsorted one.The elements from the unsorted array are picked and placed into sorted one in the correct order.
Time Complexity:
(a)Best case - O(n)
(a)Average case - O(n²)
(a)Worst case - O(n²)
Space Complexity-O(1)

(iii)Selection sort:
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 
Time Complexity:
(a)Best case - O(n²)
(a)Average case - O(n²)
(a)Worst case - O(n²)
Space Complexity-O(1)

(iv)Quick sort:
QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer technique.In this algorithm we assume a pivot element and placing the pivot element at its correct position in the array in such a way that elements to its left are smaller than it and elements to its right are greater than it.After this apply the quicksort function to the left and right part of the pivot element.
Time Complexity:
(a)Best case - O(nlogn)
(a)Average case - O(nlogn)
(a)Worst case - O(n²)
Space Complexity-O(n)

(iv)Merge sort:
MergeSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer technique.In this algorithm we divide an given array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.It is much useful for large data-sets.
Time Complexity:
(a)Best case - O(nlogn)
(a)Average case - O(nlogn)
(a)Worst case - O(nlogn)
Space Complexity-O(n)
